= Errolytics Plugin for Rails

The Errorlytics plugin provides an interface to the Errorlytics system
(http://www.errorlytics.com).  Errorlytics is an easy to use service that
centralizes reporting and handling of 404 "Page Not Found" errors for your
websites. Errorlytics gives you the tools to transparently fix the problems
quickly and easily so they never happen again. No more regex writing, no more
messing with your .htaccess file for search engine friendly redirects.
Errorlytics handles it all, effortlessly. The end results are better user
experiences and higher search engine rankings for your websites.

== Usage

Include the Errorlytics module in any controller you want to use the
Errorlytics service.  Typically you will want to use Errorlytics with all of
your controllers and thus should include the Errorlytics module in your
ApplicationController as follows:

    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      include Errorlytics
      ...
    end

The Errorlytics plugin works by defining a rescue_action_in_public method
on the controllers that it will work with.  If you have defined your own
rescue_action_in_public method for error handling then make sure to place
the include AFTER your rescue_action_in_public method.

You also need to configure Errorlytics as explained in the configuration
section below.

== Configuration

To configure Errolytics you need to set the secret key, account id, and
website id.  A good place to put this configuration would be in an
initializer or in your environment.  The code should look similar to the
following:

Errorlytics.secret_key = 'YOUR SECRET KEY';
Errorlytics.account_id = 'YOUR ACCOUNT ID';
Errorlytics.website_id = 'YOUR WEBSITE ID';

The correct values for these settings can be find on the "Rails" tab of
the "Client Plugins" section for the website you are configuring.
